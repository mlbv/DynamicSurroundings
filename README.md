### Dynamic surroundings (aka Better Rain)
Forge mod that improves the audio and visual experience of Minecraft.
Formerly known as Better Rain (still part of the codebase)
This fork is 1.7.10 only and is intended to fix a few bugs I encountered while using the mod together with the Lotr mod.
Changes from the last official 1.7.10 version (1.0.6.4):
- Updated links to this repository
- Fix version check + notification
- Fix playing wrong sounds when in lotr biomes
- Add lotr block config
